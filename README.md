### About HR Dataset v14
HR Dataset is designed by Drs. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano to accompany a case study intended for studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics. It provides comprehensive data to explore various aspects of human resources management, offering a rich source of information for in-depth analysis and insights.

### About my project
The project employs SQL for data extraction and manipulation, ensuring accurate and efficient data handling. Power BI is used for visualization, presenting the data in an accessible and visually appealing format.

The analysis focuses on two core sections:

- **Employee Overview:** This section provides a overview examination of the company's workforce. The dashboard effectively highlights key HR metrics, offering a clear picture of employee demographics, departmental distribution, salary averages, and hiring trends. These insights can be instrumental in guiding HR strategies, addressing workforce imbalances, and optimizing departmental resources.

- **Employee Details:** This section delves deeper into employees, providing a detailed analysis of these critical HR aspects. The dashboard provides a clear visualization of critical HR metrics, helping to identify areas needing attention and guiding strategic initiatives to enhance employee retention, engagement, satisfaction, and performance.

### Key Findings
- **Demographics:** The workforce has a balanced gender distribution with a slight female majority. Most of the workforce is between 35 and 45 years old, indicating a mature workforce.

- **Departments:** The Production department is the largest, suggesting it is a critical area of operation. IT/IS and Software Engineering have fewer employees but relatively higher average salaries, indicating specialized and potentially higher-skilled roles.

- **Retention rate:** Employee retention rates show signs of decreasing over the years. Strategies to enhance onboarding employee may be beneficial.

- **Engagement and Satisfaction:** While engagement and satisfaction scores are positive, the number of employees who leave within the first year of employment remains high. Employee retention strategies from the first year can boost retention rates.

- **Absenteeism:** The absenteeism rate of 1.39% is good, but it slightly exceeds the target, suggesting a need for better attendance management, especially in departments with higher absenteeism.

- **Performance and Projects:** Performance scores and special project participation show that employee performance is good. However, the special projects are needed to guarantee equal opportunities and acknowledgment for all staff members.

- Run Power BI file.

### Conclusion
During this project, I have gained valuable insights into employee demographics, departmental distribution, and key HR metrics. Utilizing SQL queries, I efficiently extracted and manipulated data, laying a solid foundation for data-driven HR strategies and decisions. This project highlights SQL's effectiveness in transforming raw data into actionable insights. Moreover, the Power BI dashboard provides the interactive elements and intuitive visualizations enable users to explore and understand the data. 

However, the project still has several weaknesses. The current dashboard relies on static data, so incorporating real-time data updates could improve its relevance and usefulness for ongoing HR management. Additionally, since the dataset is not time-series, it is difficult to fully represent changes in employee status over time.
