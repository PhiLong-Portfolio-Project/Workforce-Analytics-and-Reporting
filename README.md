### About HR Dataset v14
HR Dataset is designed by Drs. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano to accompany a case study intended for studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics. It provides comprehensive data to explore various aspects of human resources management, offering a rich source of information for in-depth analysis and insights.

### About my project
The project employs SQL for data extraction and manipulation, ensuring accurate and efficient data handling. Power BI is used for visualization, presenting the data in an accessible and visually appealing format.

The analysis focuses on two core sections:

- **Employee Overview:** This section provides a detailed examination of the company's workforce, including demographic information. It gives a clear understanding about the current number of employees, total of hired employees and total of terminated employees.
